                    Pre-ordered plants are sent out as close to the day quoted as possible, and typically we send all your items at the same time. Your plants are packed by our experienced nursery team to ensure they arrive in perfect condition to thrive in your garden.

                <p>
                    Please note: It is difficult to give exact delivery times for plants as they are living beings so we sometimes have to wait until the are the right size to send to you. If very hot or very cold weather is forecast, we may delay sending your order because extremes of temperature could damage your plants. Delivery may also take slightly longer when there are bank holidays. For these reasons, please allow up to 14 days before you contact us.

                <h2>Tracking your order</h2>
                <p>
                    Large orders are tracked and we’ll send you an email to let you know your order is on its way with a tracking link tofollow. Please note that no signature is required. This is to avoid perishable items being stuck at depots and deteriorating, and it means you don’t have to wait in for your goods to arrive. Your courier will leave your goods in a safe place - you can add a short message when you check out to give specific instructions.
